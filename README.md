# Collab-Game
Collaboration of a game. This game is a game of strategy in which two plyaers have to plan carefully how to place their next piece. 
The goal is to let your piece cover as much area as possible. Beware! Once you have placed your pieces, 
they will multiply and spread to its neighbours!

The rules are the followng:

1. To play, the first player goes one turn to place their spot to place their character X anywhere on the grid by clicking in the corresponding box
2. Then the second player has two turns to place their character O anywhere on the grid.
3. The first player places two Xs in a box that is not preoccupied. The game repeats until the board is filled up.
4. Whoever occupies the most space on the board wins!


## Timeline and Background Information

The plan for this game started in December of 2019. 
Most of the work is done between April and June of 2020.
The final stage of the project is completed on June 13th, 2020.

The code is entirely done in C.
The graphics requires the libraries <SDL.h> and <SDL_image.h> while the still playable prototype does not include any additional libraries.
We learned much of the implementation of the library from the YouTube content creator Tsoding.
